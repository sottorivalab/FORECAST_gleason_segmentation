# FORECAST Gleason Segmentation Pipeline

This repository contains the code for the semantic segmentation pipeline used to perform Gleason segmentation of whole slide images in the paper *Tumor evolution metrics predict recurrence beyond 10 years in locally advanced prostate cancer* by Fernandez-Mateos, Cresswell, Trahearn, *et al*.

Included are scripts for both training the segmentation model and performing segmentation on a whole slide image.
